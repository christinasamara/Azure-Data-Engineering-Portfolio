# 🚀 Azure Data Engineering: The DP-203 Mission

Follow me on my journey as I master the **Azure ecosystem** and prepare for the **DP-203 Data Engineering** certification! This repository tracks my progress as I translate my background in distributed systems and Python/SQL expertise into scalable cloud solutions.

I am currently following the **Microsoft Azure Data Engineer Associate (DP-203) Cert Prep by Microsoft Press** to bridge the gap between academic research and enterprise cloud architecture.
